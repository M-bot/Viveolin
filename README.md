## Inspiration
Music brings people together. By creating this new way for people to share their
own musical experiences with each other, we are bringing the world's peoples
together.
## What it does
The Vive controller plays musical notes reminiscent of the sound of a violin.
The height of the controller determines the pitch, and the velocity determines
the volume (similar to the way a violin's bow requires movement in order to
create sound). The locations of the notes are clearly visible, allowing new
learners of the Viveolin to pick up the basics quickly.
## How we built it
Using HTC Vive and Unity
None of our team members had significant experience with Unity, so we had to
learn how to create the 3D environment from scratch.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We implemented many features that real musical instruments have, such as a rich
range of dynamics and the ability to play using multiple articulations, such as
legato vs staccato. The left controller reaches a lower set of notes than the
right controller, so the total range of the instrument is expanded. Also, using
both controllers at the same time allows 2-note chords, harmonies, and even
counterpoint (for the particularly skilled musician).
## What we learned
We learned to repeatedly test and tweak our app in order to create a satisfying
experience that the user will want to engage in again and again.
## What's next for Viveolin
* Recording of songs to various audio formats (WAV, MP3, etc)
* * Multiple instruments to choose from (piano, trombone, etc.)
* * Better sound quality, more samples of real instruments
* * More complex visuals
* * Allowing user to control reverb for wider range of articulations
* * Multi-player within one environment for musical collaboration
* * Netplay with strangers from across the world
